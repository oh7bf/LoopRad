# LoopRad
Wolfram script to calculate magnetic loop fields on Raspberry Pi or other
system that has wolfram(1) language kernel available. The script is run from
command line.

```bash
./looprad.wls
```

The produced plots are written to */tmp/* directory. The script can be edited
to change rectangular loop dimensions, operation frequency and RF-current
on loop circumference. There is a good documentation on the language on
https://www.wolfram.com/.
